==================================

  * If '-P1 3337' is one of the arguments it doesn't seem to get
    passed to the arguments for mysqldump (according to the
    debugging).  [Darrell Taylor]

  * # mysqldiff --user=root --password=xxxx -B demo tables.sql
    Duplicate specification "password|p:s" for option "p"
    Duplicate specification "password1|p1:s" for option "p1"
    Duplicate specification "password2|p2:s" for option "p2"

======

  * You can't specify which database to connect to for creating
    temporary tables.

  * Things probably break if you use --password or
    -p without a parameter.

  * The remote authentication code is barely tested, and hence
    probably broken.

All easy to fix but I'm so short on time!  Patches welcome ...
